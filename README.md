# JDM Tracker System (Digital CMAS Monitoring)

A Java-based CLI application designed to assist with tracking CMAS scores and exercises for patients diagnosed with Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM). This tool allows adding new patients, assigning exercises, entering CMAS results, and viewing patient data via a simple terminal-based interface.

---

## Features

- Register new patients with name and age  
- Assign exercise tasks with description and date  
- Add CMAS scores manually  
- View patient’s progress and test history  
- Command-Line Interface (CLI)  
- Stores and reads data from a local SQLite database (`jdm.db`)  
- Imports CSV data from the `PatientX` dataset using DB Browser for SQLite  

---

## Background

**Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM)** is a rare autoimmune disease affecting muscles in children.  
**CMAS** (Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale) is a physical test used to track disease severity.

This system helps:
- Simplify data recording at home  
- Store test results digitally  
- Provide access to CMAS reports in one place
